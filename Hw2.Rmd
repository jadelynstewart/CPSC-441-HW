```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
rm(list = ls())
```
Solve:
2x + 5y = 33
x + 3y = 19

```{r}
a <- matrix(c(2,1,5,3), ncol=2, nrow=2)
b <- c(33,19)
solve(a,b)
```
This result means that x = 4 and y = 5

b) create a vector that goes from 1 to 100 and calculates the average of it WITHOUT using the R function “mean”
```{r}
x <-(1:100)
c <- sum(x)
d <- length(x)
c/d
```
This result means that the mean is 50.5

c) install the package “dplyr”
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```
3 - create a data frame of two rows with A, B, C, and D in row 1 and D, E, F, and G in row 2
```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(c("A","D","B","E","C","F","D","G"), nrow =2, ncol = 4)
as.data.frame(matrix1)
```
